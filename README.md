## Backstory
I am part of the 0.0000001% of users who likes to download pools, convert them to pdf's and red them on an e-ink device. For the longest time I was using [jacklul's pool downloader](https://github.com/jacklul/e621-Pool-Downloader); it worked well enough until one day I saw that they had archived the repo, they would no longet manain or update it, this gave me an idea, what if I made my own downloader in c#? how hard could it be? ...

After lots of frustration and keyboard bashing (and also the very helpful people on the e6 forums, thanks :D) the program finally works!
